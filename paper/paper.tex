\section{Introduction}

Industrial systems form the backbone of modern society. Ensuring the reliability of these systems should thus be an important goal. 
TODO real world failing examples

Arianne rocket accident!

In the remainder of this paper, we present the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a novel framework which allow the Verifying
    \item an implementation of this framework based on the factory simulator factorio
    \item 

We propose a novel approach to verify a variety of properties which in combination ensure the correct behaviour of a factory. We 



\section{Verifying Factories}

\subsection{Memory Safety}
You don't have the wrong thing on a belt. 
\begin{itemize}
\item every half belt only ever has a single item type on it
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Liveness}
Things get produced at some point
\begin{itemize}
\item Every assembler has the input it needs
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Bug freedom}

No biters can enter the factory. In increasing levels of complexity:

\begin{itemize}
\item Walls surround the factory
\item Turrets protect every walls
\item Turrets receive ammo
\end{itemize}




% Other ideas 
% - Input and output of things are pre- and postconditions
% - Concurrency: multiple players play at once
% - Modularity: subfactories/tileable/something with modules?
% - Invariants???

\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
We have implemented our approach as
